We have a new API!

Getting from A to B is a lot more than just planning a journey to your destination, or following a schedule when using public transport. Travel is impacted by all sorts of things: that pothole is finally getting fixed, the stop you always use has moved, the ABs are trying to win again, or Slipknot is calling metal fans out of their basements - something is always happening in this city of ours.

Auckland Transport is now publishing the data they have through their [api portal](https://dev-portal.at.govt.nz/). It is a first "stab" at this, and clearly not particularly polished. We want to hear from you what you'd like to do with the data - what form should it take to be useful for you?

We added some details about this API to ATLabs, please see our [getting started]({{ site.baseurl }}/gettingstarted/2016/10/12/notifications-api/) section for everything (?) worth knowing.

Leave us a note on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/at-labs/Lobby); we'll collect the feedback, and approach Auckland Transport to make this API the best it can be. Sounds good?
